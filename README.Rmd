`ragnar` is an R package that helps implement Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) workflows. It focuses on providing a complete solution
with sensible defaults, while still giving the knowledgeable user
precise control over each step. We don't believe that you can fully
automate the creation of a good RAG system, so it's important that
`ragnar` is not a black box. `ragnar` is designed to be transparent. You
can easily inspect outputs at intermediate steps to understand what's
happening.

## Installation

You can install ragnar from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("ragnar")
```

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidyverse/ragnar")
```

## Key Steps

### 1. Document Processing

`ragnar` works with a wide variety of document types, using
[MarkItDown](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) to convert content
to Markdown.

Key functions:

-   `read_as_markdown()`: Convert a file or URL to markdown
-   `ragnar_find_links()`: Find all links in a webpage

### 2. Text Chunking

Next we divide each document into chunks. Ragnar defaults to a strategy
that preserves some of the semantics of the document, but provides
plenty of opportunities to tweak the approach.

Key functions:

-   `markdown_chunk()`: Full-featured chunker that identifies semantic
    boundaries and intelligently chunks text.

### 3. Context Augmentation (Optional)

RAG applications benefit from augmenting text chunks with additional
context, such as document headings and subheadings. `ragnar` makes it
easy to keep track of headings and subheadings as part of chunking.

`markdown_chunk()` automatically associates each chunk with the headings
that are in scope for that chunk.

### 4. Embedding

`ragnar` can help compute embeddings for each chunk. The goal is for
`ragnar` to provide access to embeddings from popular LLM providers.

Key functions:

-   `embed_ollama()`
-   `embed_openai()`
-   `embed_bedrock()`
-   `embed_databricks()`
-   `embed_google_vertex()`

Note that calling the embedding function directly is typically not
necessary. Instead, the embedding function is specified when a store is
first created, and then automatically called when needed by
`ragnar_retrieve()` and `ragnar_store_insert()`.

### 5. Storage

Processed data is stored in a format optimized for efficient searching,
using `duckdb` by default. The API is designed to be extensible,
allowing additional packages to implement support for different storage
providers.

Key functions:

-   `ragnar_store_create()`
-   `ragnar_store_connect()`
-   `ragnar_store_insert()`

### 6. Retrieval

Given a prompt, retrieve related chunks based on embedding distance or
bm25 text search.

Key functions:

-   `ragnar_retrieve()`: high-level function that performs both `vss`
    and `bm25` search and de-overlaps retrieved results.
-   `ragnar_retrieve_vss()`: Retrieve using [`vss` DuckDB
    extension](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/vss)
-   `ragnar_retrieve_bm25()`: Retrieve using
    [`full-text search DuckDB extension`](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/core_extensions/full_text_search)
-   `chunks_deoverlap()`: Consolidates retrieved chunks that overlap.

### 7. Chat Augmentation

`ragnar` can equip an `ellmer::Chat` object with a retrieve tool that
enables an LLM to retrieve content from a store on-demand.

-   `ragnar_register_tool_retrieve(chat, store)`.

## Usage

Here's an example of using `ragnar` to create a knowledge store from the
*R for Data Science (2e)* book:

```{r, code = readLines("examples/example-create-store.R")}
```

Once the store is set up, you can then retrieve the most relevant text
chunks.

```{r, code = readLines("examples/example-retrieve.R")}
```
