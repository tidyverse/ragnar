\usage{
markdown_chunk(
  md,
  target_size = 1600L,
  target_overlap = 0.5,
  ...,
  max_snap_dist = target_size * (1 - target_overlap)/3,
  headings = TRUE,
  pre_segment_heading_levels = 0L,
  text = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{md}{A length-one character vector containing Markdown.}

\item{target_size}{Integer. Target chunk size in characters. Default: \code{1600}
(≈ 400 tokens).}

\item{target_overlap}{Numeric in \verb{[0, 1)}. Fraction of desired overlap
between successive chunks. Default: \code{0.5}. Even when \code{0}, small overlaps
can occur because the last chunk is anchored to the document end.}

\item{...}{Must be empty.}

\item{max_snap_dist}{Integer. Furthest distance (in characters) a cut point
may move to reach a boundary. Defaults to one third of the stride size
between target chunk start. Chunks that end up on identical boundaries are
merged.}

\item{headings}{Logical. Add a \code{headings} column containing the Markdown
headings in scope at each chunk start. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{pre_segment_heading_levels}{Integer. Headings at or above this level
are treated as hard segment breaks before chunking. Default: \code{0}
(disabled).}

\item{text}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, include a \code{text} column with the chunk
contents. Default: \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with at least:
\itemize{
\item \code{start}: 1-based start position of the chunk in \code{md}.
\item \code{end}:  inclusive end position.
}

Additional \code{headings} and/or \code{text} columns are present when requested.
}
\description{
\code{markdown_chunk()} splits a single Markdown string into fixed-length,
optionally overlapping chunks while nudging cut points to the nearest
sensible boundary (heading, paragraph, sentence, word, or character). It
returns a tibble recording the character ranges of each chunk and, if
requested, the heading context and the text itself.

# Title

## Section one

Some text that is long enough to be chunked.

A second paragraph to make the text even longer.

## Section two

More text here.
